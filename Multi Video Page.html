            <h2 class="song-title">Oh que será? - Willie Colón</h2>
            <p class="song-description">
                I've been introduced to this artist by my friend for his notable albums: Siembra, and Lo Mato.
                Both of which I enjoyed a lot. I know that this is one of Colón's most popular songs but it's really just a great song to listen to.

            <h2 class="song-title">Beautiful World - Hikaru Utada</h2>
            <p class="song-description">
                I've known Hikaru Utada for a long time. Most notably for: Simple and Clean, and Sanctuary both from the Kingdom Hearts franchise that I'm a fan of.
                This song 'Beautiful World' was produced for the new Evangelion movie that released at the time. Although I'm not too familar with the franchise,
                I recognise its cultural significance in media.

            <h2 class="song-title">The Greatest Bend Over - Full Blown, Yung Bredda</h2>
            <p class="song-description">
                Soca is a genre that I love to listen to especially at parties. I found this song in a Carribean mix filled with other genres such as Dancehall, Reggaeton, Afrobeats, etc.
                The song itself is quite catchy and semi-recent as it was produced in 2025. Ultimately it's a good song that I hope you enjoy!
