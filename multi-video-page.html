            <h2 class="song-title">Oh que será? - Willie Colón</h2>
            <p class="song-description">
                I've been introduced to this artist by my friend for his notable albums: Siembra, and Lo Mato.
                Both of which I enjoyed a lot. I know that this is one of Colón's most popular songs but it's really just a great song to listen to.

            <h2 class="song-title">Beautiful World - Hikaru Utada</h2>
            <p class="song-description">
                I've known Hikaru Utada for a long time. Most notably for: Simple and Clean, and Sanctuary both from the Kingdom Hearts franchise that I'm a fan of.
                This song 'Beautiful World' was produced for the new Evangelion movie that released at the time. Although I'm not too familar with the franchise,
                I recognise its cultural significance in media.

            <h2 class="song-title">The Greatest Bend Over - Full Blown, Yung Bredda</h2>
            <p class="song-description">
                Soca is a genre that I love to listen to especially at parties. I found this song in a Carribean mix filled with other genres such as Dancehall, Reggaeton, Afrobeats, etc.
                The song itself is quite catchy and semi-recent as it was produced in 2025. Ultimately it's a good song that I hope you enjoy!

            <p class="song-description">
                I have been getting back into electronic music (I never left) and I enjoy the DnB of this song and it transitions well with the Love me U by DJ Genki.</p>

            <p class="song-description">This is a JCore song made in 2013 under the Hardcore TANO*C label. I like a bunch of their stuff most notably their TANO*C EXTRA which is a Compilation of various artists.</p>

            <h2 class="song-title"> DJ S3RL </h2>
            <p class="song-description">I've listened to S3RL for a long time specifically his older more popular songs like Pretty Rave Girl, Feel the Melody, MTC, etc. I've decided to go back and listen to some of his older songs that I've used to play a couple years back, and these were some of my favorite: Candy, I'll See You Again, Nightcore This, & Over the Rainbow. Below is a mega mix of his songs. For those looking for the genre its Happy Hardcore.</p>
